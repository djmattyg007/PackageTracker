PackageTracker

This project is designed to keep track of packages from various sources,
to allow you to determine whether or not the dependencies of your project
are out of date.

Currently, it supports npm (JavaScript), Packagist (PHP), PyPI (python),
and rubygems (Ruby).

This is still a work in progress. Expect things to change.
